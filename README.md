## Google Maps App

# Description

  This project showcases how to integrate Google Maps into an ASP.NET web application using the Google Maps JavaScript API. The application allows users to interact with a fully functional map embedded on a web page. Core functionalities include displaying locations, custom markers, and utilizing location-based services.

  All data, including latitude, longitude, and descriptions, is securely stored in a database and linked to individual user accounts. The application ensures a responsive and dynamic experience, leveraging modern web technologies and real-time updates.

  This integration leverages the strengths of Google Maps APIs, ASP.NET Core/MVC, and JavaScript, making it suitable for applications like location management systems, delivery tracking, and travel planning tools.
